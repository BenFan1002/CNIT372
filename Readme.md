# Theme

The theme of the CNIT 372  project revolves around analyzing and understanding YouTube video statistics and creator data. The primary focus is to extract meaningful insights from data related to YouTube creators, such as their subscriber counts, total views, country of residence, and video upload counts. The project aims to identify content engagement patterns, geographical trends, and preferences for content categories among YouTube users. By analyzing this data, we intend to uncover how different types of videos gain popularity at various times of the year, influenced by factors such as seasonal events and the YouTube algorithm. This thematic exploration is crucial for understanding the dynamics of content consumption and popularity on YouTube, a major digital platform.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of YouTube video statistics to inform content strategies, identify target demographics, and recognize popular content genres. The insights gained from the data are critical for understanding which videos are popular at different times of the year, thereby enabling content creators and marketers to optimize their strategies around key events like Christmas. The project intends to structure this data into three main tables: Creator, Video, and Category, with flexibility to add more tables if necessary. This structured approach to data storage and analysis is designed to facilitate a deeper understanding of YouTube's content landscape and user engagement trends, ultimately aiding in the development of more effective content and marketing strategies on the platform.

# Use Instructions

Inorder to run the code correctly

First, Run the Create Tables.sql to create three tables we have defined.

Second, Run the InsertCreator.sql, InsertVideo.sql,InsertCategorys.sql to fill in the data we have used for our proejct.

Last, the code for each question in package format can be found in Create Package.sql where all questions is created into functions, but the version we have used more closely in answering the question is Seperate Test.sql, if some code don't work in Create Package.sql, please check the version we had in the Seperate Test.sql.

a. A script for importing data into an empty database:  Create Tables.sql  InsertCreator.sql, InsertVideo.sql,InsertCategorys.sql
b. The project description from Milestone 1 and the question list from Milestone 2.: Proejct Description.pdf
c. The solutions you have implemented, labeled by the corresponding questions.: Create Package.sql / Seperate Test.sql.
