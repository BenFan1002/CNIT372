Inorder to run the code correctly

First, Run the Create Tables.sql to create three tables we have defined.

Second, Run the InsertCreator.sql, InsertVideo.sql,InsertCategorys.sql to fill in the data we have used for our proejct.

Last, the code for each question in package format can be found in Create Package.sql where all questions is created into functions, but the version we have used more closely in answering the question is Seperate Test.sql, if some code don't work in Create Package.sql, please check the version we had in the Seperate Test.sql.
